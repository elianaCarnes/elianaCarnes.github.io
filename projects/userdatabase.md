This project is a C-based database I created as a final project in ICS 212, Fall 2024. The application operates on a Unix system and uses file-based storage to handle user input.

Vacay is implemented using [Meteor](http://meteor.com), a JavaScript application platform. Within two weeks, we created a website that implements several types of reservations including flights, hotels, and car rentals.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming. 

Here is some example code to illustrate Simple Schema use:
