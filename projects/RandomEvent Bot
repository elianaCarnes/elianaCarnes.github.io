summary: "A program that generates random events for a discord server"
---

RandomEvent Bot is a discord bot that I helped create with my friend last year. Using Python we developed an automated system to generate activities in our server, this project introduced me to using real world API's.

I primarily contributed an object based system that randomized events, assigning each event a rarity status, in this project I learned how to integreate Discord's external tools and was introduced to Python. 

A unique problem I encoutered with this bot was my friends spamming the command, and we had to make another iteration of RandomEvent Bot that had a cooldown.
Here is it in use:
