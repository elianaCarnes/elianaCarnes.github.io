As an Intern at LCF a part of my job was digitizing physical grant records dating as far back as 2000. In this process I created a profile for each grants document and uploaded scans of the physical pages. For each grant I also kept records of the companies involved, key contacts and other relevant information. 

A large part of this process was using Linkedin to track employees/companies that were involved in these grants. After 20 years many of the companies involved have merged or changed, but with Linkedin I was able to find the past employees involved for record keeping purposes. 

Through this six-month-long project I became comfortable with excel, using it to organize large amounts of data. Additionally, I learned a lot about Linkedin and the importance of a professional identity online.
