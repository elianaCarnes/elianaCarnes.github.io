As an intern at the Latino Community Foundation, known as LCF, one of my responsibilities was digitilizing physical grant records that dated back to the companies founding. I worked with physical paperwokr to create digital records within both Salesforce and Microsoft Excel. Each entry included key information such as a scan of the grant agreement, funding purpose and organizations involved. 

I used Excel to manage a large quantity of data by year, with each entry connected to a Salesforce profile that contained further information. With Excel's hyperlink function, I was able to generate links to each Salesforce record based on each entry's unique ID within the companies Salesforce domain.

# Challenges I faced
After years, many companies had merged or changed over the years. Being able to use sites like Linkedin was essential to this project, as it allowed me to find record of these companies that was not otherwise avaliable. With the use of Linkedin I was also abble to find current record of the employees involved in the grant and provide refrence to them, which allowed for me to provide contact to those involved with the grant partnership for refrence.
