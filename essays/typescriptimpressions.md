## Initial Observations
As someone with experience with C++, I can confidently say Typescript is my preference. C++ can often be demanding from a user perspective as it forces the programmer to think about how memory is being managed. I felt that with Typescript I'm able to focus more on problem-solving and worry less about syntax. 

One thing I immediately noticed was how intuitive Typescript is. Although I have only begun to scratch the surface, there are quality-of-life changes that make programming with Typescript feel less restrictive. In my experience with C++ there is always an additional step in order to perform tasks you might expect of a programming language. For example, when working with functions you have to import the string library just to work with strings. But in Typescript I can just write a function that returns a string, and that's it. There are other small things I appreciate like ASI and type inference that make Typescript a more straightforward experience. 

## My Learning Experience
I really enjoy the readability and flexibility of Typescript. Not only does the syntax itself feel easy to understand but Typescript is very dynamic with what it allows the user to do. This design choice gives the programmer freedom to explore how the different features interact, and ultimately gives Typescript a creative component. With C++ I always felt restricted, and while there are always multiple ways to a solution, there are a lot of limitations to consider when coding in C++. 

I most noticed this lack of restriction when it came to objects. In Typescript objects can be modified and changed with ease. You can even make an object without having a class for the object, which is unheard of in C++. I feel pushed to experiment and learn the boundaries of Typescript. 

From a software engineering perspective, I would say Typescript is designed with the programmer in mind. It's been enjoyable to learn about and I would recommend it to others.
