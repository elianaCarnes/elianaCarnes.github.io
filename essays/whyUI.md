## The question
It is easy to look at a framework like Bootstrap 5 and ask why use it at all, when all the enhancements that using frameworks provide can already be established purely through HTML and CSS. However, this comparison is like asking why would you buy a pre-made cake mix when you can make a cake from scratch. Mainly, you do it for convinence. When it comes to coding it is much more complicated to use languages without frameworks as the languages were made years in the past. With frameworks, not only are new systems always being perfected and reinvented, but knowledge of how a framework functions behind the scenes gives the same understanding as souley using a coding language while removing the complexity behind it. Being able to effectively understand and utilize frameworks allows programmers to save time and constantly modernize old techonologies.

UI frameworks introduce efficiency to coding and reduce the complexity involved with large-scale coding projects. Without frameworks a simple task may need a handful of lines to be executed, and this will add up to the program being highly complex. This not only makes development more time-consuming but also increases the likelihood of errors, inconsistencies, and compatibility issues across different devices and browsers. By using a framework, developers can avoid the need to write repetitive code, allowing them to focus on more on the project and less on errors.

## My opinion
It is entirely worth it to learn frameworks, even if it may seem as complex as learning a coding language all together. Frameworks provide a consistency and have a structure that can be especially helpful in a team or group setting. If everyone working together is familar with a framework it is essentially like having a version of the coding language that is tailored to best suit your project. I appreciate frameworks for how they reduce complexity, are optimized to work across various systems and enhance collaborative programming. It opens new horizons for programmers and makes work more efficient.
