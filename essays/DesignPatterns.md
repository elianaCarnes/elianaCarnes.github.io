## Understanding Design Patterns

A design pattern offers a repeatable solution to problems that software developers often encounter. These solutions are strategies that guide how to organize and structure code in a consistent, clean and scalable manner when solving a common problem. By utilizing these patterns, developers can avoid common mistakes that often occur in that particular problem and make design choices knowing the approach has worked in a similar context before. Instead of having to focus on low-level details like syntax, design patterns help developers focus more time on the intent of their code. A comparison to understand the relationship between software developers and design patterns, picture a chef and the recipes they use. When preparing a dish with many parts, a recipe gives a proven process that ensures everything works together cohesively. Design patterns give developers a structured guide for solving problems that frequently occur, which help produce reliable results consistently.

## The Benefit of Design Patterns

Design patterns are useful in a variety of ways. On top of making common problems quicker to solve, they also help the developer recognize specific types of problems when these strategies can be applied. A developer that is familiar with design patterns can identify recurring problems and approach them with solutions that are structurally sound and already consider common errors. By using these patterns developers can make design choices that are known to perform consistently, which not only saves time in problem-solving, but helps with making stable programs.

Beyond helping individual developers recognize and solve problems faster, design patterns are also helpful when collaborating in a team. When a team agrees to use a design pattern, everyone is able to quickly understand what structure needs to be made in order to solve the problem without additional planning. In long-term projects this is also helpful for a team member who looks at your code, since others are able to quickly recognize the design pattern in your code and see how it is used throughout the program. This allows for groups to spend less time trying to understand specific logic and work more collaboratively by using design patterns throughout the project. 

For example, in my final database project written in C++, I used the Singleton design pattern to manage a debug mode throughout the program. Since the debug flag needed to be accessible throughout multiple functions across a few different files, it needed to be implemented in a way that prevented any accidental duplication. By encapsulating the debug flag in a Singleton, I was able to ensure that only one shared instance managed that state. This approach enabled every piece of the program to reference the same debug configuration without needing to pass it explicitly through function calls or rely on repetitive code throughout multiple files.
