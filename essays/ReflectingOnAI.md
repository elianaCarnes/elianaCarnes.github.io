## Introduction 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to systems like ChatGPT, Midjourney, Gemini or Copilot, these systems are designed to perform tasks which would previously rely on a person. These systems are capable of processing large datasets and able to generate replies based on trained ata. In the context of software engineering, AI is capable of both writing and debugging code, it can help explain concepts and suggest improvements. In my experience with ICS314, I utilized ChatGPT as a way of reinforcing the concepts we had learned.

## Personal Experience with AI

1. Experience WODs e.g. E18: 
For the experience WODs, I used AI to answer any questions I had. When I was first installing Node.js, I was able to use ChatGPT to solve the issue of my development environment not picking up on the installation. 

2. In-class Practice WODs:
As these were practice WODs for the timed ones, I kept my use of AI minimal to build my ability for the actual WODs. I remember once my development environment was not working, and I was able to fix it by asking ChatGPT, and the reason was I had a conflict with an extension on my Google Chrome. 

3. In-class WODs:
I did not use AI for the timed WODs as I wanted to see if I was truly able to perform under the constraint. While using AI was an option, I felt that the time given was enough for me to work out a lot of my errors without having to use AI. 

4. Essays:
It was important to me that all of my essays truly reflected my ideas and opinions on the topics, so I avoided the use of AI for my essays as I did not want any influence on the tone of my writing. 

5. Final project:
For my final project AI was a tool that benefitted me and my team, by using AI we were able to correct an issue I was having with the file path for my database. Because my postgreSQL was downloaded to a Onedrive folder, I had to use a different command for prisma migration. ChatGPT was able to generate this command and I saved it for future use. 

6. Learning a concept / tutorial: 
For any learning concepts I did ask AI some questions but I do not remember any specific examples, but It was helpful in further breaking down concepts and answering some of the questions I had. I do recognize I could also search for my questions on google, but with ChatGPT it is helpful as you can build on what you said before and personalize the explanation you receive. 

7. Answering a question in class or in Discord:
I did not use AI to answer any questions in the discord, and most of the questions were more related to the class itself and not what was being taught. I feel using AI to answer another persons question is not needed, as you are not truly giving your response. 

8. Asking or answering a smart-question:
For any of my questions I did not use AI, as I was able to say what I needed for others to understand and respond. I could see how AI could help ask a question if you were not sure how to properly word it, but I did not have this experience. 

9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”:
Instead of using ChatGPT for tasks like this I prefer to look at different websites like geeksforgeeks.org that provide detailed explanations of the code along with examples in multiple contexts. 

10. Explaining code:
When we first started using the Next.js application template I used ChatGPT to help me better understand how the files interact with one another. The AI broke down the role of each folder, like how files in the pages directory map to routes.

11. Writing code:
I avoided the use of AI in writing my code, personally, I feel that I can read my code easier when I remember writing each part of it. 

12. Documenting code:
I did not use AI to document any code as I wanted to practice documentation, as I feel it is often as important as writing the code itself.  

13. Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code” or “Fix the ESLint errors”:
I often encountered an ESLint error for my remake of the Kona Coffee site where the length of a line was too long. With ChatGPT I restructured the line in order for the amount of characters to not exceed the limit while also retaining a format that was similar to the original.  

14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed:
In the past I have used ChatGPT to help me compare ticket prices from different airlines, and It was very helpful in both finding good rates and making the comparison for different benefits like if an airline included a checked bag or not.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding
I feel that my use of AI in ICS 314 has helped my understanding of the concepts. It was helpful to be able to ask AI any questions I had about what we were learning in class, and through asking questions to AI I was able to have a back and forth similar to interacting with the teacher. If I wanted to know why ESLint showed an error for something that might seem small, AI was able to explain step by step, and It helped me understand why we implement the guidelines. With the use of AI tools like ChatGPT I was able to have the same experience as talking with a professor about any issues I was having or any questions.  

## Practical Applications
While I have not used AI extensively, it is clear how these tools can apply to real-world software engineering challenges. AI can save time on writing code by suggesting syntax corrections, and some software developers use AI to save time not doing repetitive tasks like HTML layouts. In a professional context, it is important to manage your time effectively and spend the most time on solving the problem and ensuring your code has solid logic instead of doing repetitive tasks like writing the CSS for every component. 

## Challenges and Opportunities
With my use of AI in this course I have not noticed any challenges that it has, although sometimes AI has a tendency of giving you the same solution or answer repeatedly if it is unsure what to do. I believe with more time AI will only improve at solving errors and understanding software, and in the field of software engineering it has great potential to help people save time. I think this feature of AI will be incredibly valuable in the future, as the more time we spend on repetition the more time people spend on innovation. 

## Comparative Analysis
I think the use of AI in education has both benefits and disadvantages, but the main detriment is skill development. With programming, I think it is essential to repeat a task a certain amount of times entirely by yourself in order to have a true understanding of the concept. With AI, you might have an understanding of the concept but when asked to write it entirely by yourself you wont have the same ability as someone who has been writing each line on their own. AI is great for asking questions, and it was incredibly helpful to me in solving problems I was having with my computer and development environments. Traditional learning is important for having a genuine understanding of the material being taught, and the use of AI is best reserved for answering questions so it does not impact an individual's ability. 

## Future Considerations
I think AI has a place in the education of software engineering, as it evolves I can see AI acting as another teacher. It has the potential to explain concepts that previously you could only ask your professor for further clarification on. A challenge AI faces is ensuring information it provides is entirely accurate and not influenced by the opinion of those who are providing the data for training. As we continue to make advancements in AI I believe it will be a great resource for explaining concepts. 

## Conclusion
Overall, my experience with AI in ICS314 has been helpful to my understanding of the material of the course. I have been able to ask questions and solve problems that the professor could have helped me with. As it stands, I think the use of AI in this course is productive and is conducive to learning while also allowing for the students to discover and understand things on their own. Combined with the couse material, AI has helped me with any questions I have had throughout ICS 314.
