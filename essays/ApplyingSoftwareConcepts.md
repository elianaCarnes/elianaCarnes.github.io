Understanding and applying software engineering concepts is fundamental to professional software development. Being able to write working code is important, but it is not enough to ensure systems remain maintainable and reliable. Software engineering concepts are the techniques and methods that software engineers use to design software in a way that can adapt to changes, perform consistently and help others understand the program quickly. With these concepts in practice, I was able to improve as a developer and work more effectively in a team.

## Improving the Structure of Code
To make code that is not only functional, but also easy to maintain, improve on and understand, many developers use design patterns. These are known, reusable solutions to common problems found in programming. In my experience, using design patterns provides a clear and organized way to structure a program. This makes it easier to add new features and make changes without altering existing functionality. For example, I implemented the Strategy pattern for a project that focused on sorting. The Strategy pattern allows a program to define a family of related algorithms, separate each individual algorithm into its own component and make them interchangeable at runtime. Instead of having one single approach to the problem, I was able to use different strategies like quicksort or mergesort in the same interface, which enabled the program to select which strategy was best based on factors like data size. With this design pattern I was able to make a program that was more adaptable, without the changing sorting functions affecting the rest of my system. I also noticed how using design patterns helps in collaborative settings, as developers can work on different aspects of the program without the risk of altering the entire system. Since design patterns often enforce a clear separation of responsibilities, each team member is able to focus on their components while the remainder of the project is unaffected. Using design patterns leads to more stable code, that is not only stable but capable of being adjusted or added to. 

## Agile Project Management
Agile Project Management refers to organizing work in a team while allowing for the flexibility of changing requirements often found in software development. This method of project management breaks the project down into smaller units that can be completed in cycles. With an agile approach, the team is able to adapt quickly to any changes or challenges. While developing our app Manoa Food Finder, we utilized a style of Agile Project Management called Issue-Driven Project Management (IDPM). With this style, every task is listed as an issue with a description, assigned developer and criteria for completion. These issues then are assigned to three labels: To Do, In Progress, and Done, which allows for others working on the same project to understand each task's progress. In developing my application, IDPM allowed for us to divide work and help one another when issues arised. When we encountered a problem with the database, we were able to adjust quickly by reassigning tasks so one person could focus on solving the issue. Using Agile Project Management styles is helpful beyond designing an application, it is a strategy to improve teamwork and divide up work in a manner that is clearly outlined for everyone involved. This way, everyone knows how and what they have to complete along with the flexibility needed for individual needs.
