## Highlights
My favorite part of software engineering is being able to solve problems. When coding, you have to use creative thinking to find solutions and be adaptable to the rules of the world around you. 
Through software engineering I can practice problem solving in a creative way, while constantly learning about new things. To me, coding has the same effect as painting. Initially you have a blank canvas; but after putting the time in you have a whole picture. There are so many different languages and frameworks that allow software engineering to never become repetitive, and there is always more to learn.

## What kind of skills and experiences do you hope to develop in the future?
In the future, I hope to learn how to better optimize my programs through system architecture and algorithms. These components of computer science are crucial in becoming a more effective developer. It is not only important to build functioning programs but efficient ones. 
I would also like to develop my skills as a writer. By developing my writing ability I can better communicate ideas, document my work and operate in a collaborative enviorment. Good writing skills means that information about the program is clearly conveyed to the other individuals you may be working with. In a team setting it is crucial to have accurate and concise comments, so I aim to become a better writer to become a better team player.
