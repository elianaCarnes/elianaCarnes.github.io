## The Value of Coding Standards 
The best way to improve a programs readability is by using a set of stylistic guidelines called coding standards. Coding standards work to format code consistetnly by defining rules for how code should be formatted. After my first week of working with ESLint and VScode, I notice how using coding standards have helped me code more efficiently. Using consistently structured code allows for a program to be easily read; and by having consistent standards throughout a program it saves time when debugging and looking for errors or places you can make improvements. 

After mostly using Javascript, I initially found ESLint to be notably stricter. It often flagged minor formatting inconsistencies that wouldn't have been a problem if they werent there. But over time, I realized that keeping organized code does save time, particularly with large-scale projects that have multiple files interacting. But with the guidelines from ESLint, my code became easier to follow. Sometimes it's easy to ignore how small inconsistencies add up to make a program look more complex than it truly is. By using a more structured format to my code my programs are clearer, not only to read but to improve on and maintain. 

## The Importance of Consistency  
Having consistent formatting is essential to writing maintainable code. Guidelines allow for the user to prevent small errors before they occur. An example of this is how ESLint enforces the use of === instead of ==, which ensures that any comparisons do not result in unexpected type conversions. By using these guidelines consistently throughout a program you ultimately develop good coding habits and create more organized programs overall. Coding with ESLint saves time by being designed with the developer in mind, allowing for less errors throughout a program along with making the program easy to understand. 

Consistency is also essential in a professional enviorment. When working with multiple people, systems and files interacting with one another things can become messy as collaborators different styles are present in their code. When there is not a format thats used throughout the entire project, the project does not look cohesive and becomes increasingly difficult to understand. By using coding standards, every person in a team is able to look at the code and understand it, because now everyone is using the same structure when writing their program. By having an organized program it ensures less time is spent trying to understand what others on a team have written and more time is spent optimizing and problem solving.

## Conclusion
I feel like ESLint is helping me to become a more professional programmer while also enforcing good habits that contribute to maintainable code. Guidelines for structure and format make code more consistent not only when you work by yourself, but also when you work on a team with others. By using coding standards in my programs, I make my code more efficient and easy to read. Consistency reduces the time spent searching for errors as functions are standardized and clear at a glance. As I work more with tools like ESLint, I'm learning how important it is to use coding standards in my programs.
