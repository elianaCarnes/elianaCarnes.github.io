## My Reflection
Coding standards are stylistic guidelines that can be implemented to shape a code's readability and clarity, and after my first week of using ESLint with VScode, I have come to understand the importance of coding standards when it comes to developing better coding habits. By having clearly structured code it makes coding more efficient, as you save time going back on errors 
that could have come up later in testing. Using coding standards to format code can make the program consistent, which saves time on debugging and increases readability.

After spending time with the unrestrictive syntax of Javascript, I found ESLint to be overly corrective, with minor formatting inconsistencies being flagged that mightâ€™ve not otherwise been an issue. Yet I quickly came to realize that it is very important to keep uniform code. Especially when it comes to a large-scale project, you may struggle to find the root cause of an error, and with the guidelines enforced by ESLint I notice how uniform my code has become much more structured. When there are many small inconsistencies they accumulate and make a program unnecessarily complex. When you remove this risk and ensure you have a program that is formatted according to specific guidelines it makes the code clearer, not only in terms of comprehensibility but in terms of maintainability and efficiency. A well-structured program is easy to understand, and you may be able to find flaws in logic and make changes quicker. 

## Why Consistency Matters in Coding
Small rules contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable program. Like how ESLint enforces the use of === instead of ==, or how Typescript enforces a datatype to be stated in the function definition. This way, you prevent small errors like the incorrect value being returned. These guidelines are made with the programmer in mind, and ultimately contribute to the development of good coding habits that will make programs more organized. Not only do coding standards save time but they are designed to prevent common errors. 

Another aspect of coding standards is the value it carries in a professional environment. When dealing with multiple interacting systems, files and functions things can become unclear as many programmers' unique styles come through in their programming. Without a standardized format, navigating a repository operated by many different people can become a daunting task. A unified coding standard allows for anyone on the team to take a glance at the program and understand it, as it follows the exact same methods they use to write their own program. When things are clear, with proper spacing and a logical organization, it ensures less time is spent on comprehension and more time is spent on problem solving.

#Final Thoughts
Overall my experience using ESLint has been valuable as I learn to use strategies that enhance my code's readability while also building better habits as a programmer. I have learned to refine my coding style in a way that makes my programs more efficient and clear. Not only does the implementation of coding standards improve your personal experience, it improves collaboration as everyone works on a unified project instead of a joined collective. As I continue to learn, I recognize the importance of coding standards is creating organized and consistent code that can be easily understood.
